# hello-world

Eh Coders!

RWC here, i'm new to this whole programming world.
I plan on learning as much as i can and get decent at it.
The languages i want to learn are python and C, C++.
I enjoy fresh brewed coffee as well.
I like my coffee black just like my metal.
Feel free to throw tips my way if you've got any.
